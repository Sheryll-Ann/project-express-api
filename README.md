# Project Express API

This week's project is to start a backend journey by creating an API using Express. This API should have a couple of RESTful endpoints which return either an array of data or a single item.

A hard-coded set of data, stored as a JSON file, is used in this project: books.json (consisting of 450 books).

## Implementation

The installed Nodemon is a utility monitoring for any changes in your source and automatically restarting your Node.js application when your code changes. Perfect for development.

`npm install -g nodemon`

The endpoint "/" returns documentation of your API using [Express List Endpoints](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-list-endpoints)
